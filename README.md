# My Bio: 
Jordan Noone is an aerospace engineer, entrepreneur, and early-stage investor focused on deep tech innovations. He is Co-Founder and General Partner at Embedded Ventures, a venture capital firm investing in pre-seed to Series A startups in space operations, digital engineering, and advanced manufacturing. He also co-founded Zoo (formerly KittyCAD), where he serves as Executive Chairman, helping build the future of hardware design tools and infrastructure.

Jordan began his journey designing and building spaceflight hardware as a student at the University of Southern California. He led USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab, becoming the youngest person ever to receive FAA clearance to launch a rocket outside Earth's atmosphere. He then went on to intern at Blue Origin and engineer propulsion systems at SpaceX. In 2015, he co-founded Relativity Space, where he served as the founding CTO, guiding direction across everything from propulsion and launch-vehicle design to factory scale printing and software infrastructure.

He holds a BS in Aerospace Engineering from USC (he enrolled in Biophysics before refocusing fully on aerospace) and remains deeply involved with his alma mater through USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab and the University's President's Leadership Council. Jordan lives in the greater Los Angeles area.
